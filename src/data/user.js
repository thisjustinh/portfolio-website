			"I am a developer of new technologies and data scientist looking for new problems to solve. I love applying different forms of machine learning and deep learning to create real-world solutions. My work has taught me a lot about using Python and PyTorch, R, database management, and other skills. I hope to apply these skills into other fields.",

		title: "Iâ€™m Justin Huang.",
		description:
			"I'm a CS and Statistics graduate from the Schreyer Honors College at Penn State. I've worked on a variety of projects hosted on GitHub over the years and I'm proud of the progress I've made. In particular, I'm familiar with convolutional and graph neural networks, fairness, data modeling, time series analysis, and more. Although I've worked with GANs before, I hope to learn more about generative AI, like LLMs and audio creation.",
