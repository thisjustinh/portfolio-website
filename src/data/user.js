			"I am a machine learning engineer working on incorporating new technologies into business use cases. Currently at Rockwell Automation, I am a data scientist: in the industrial automation space, we work a lot with signals and hardware lifecycles, so creating AI/ML tools that can leverage predictive maintenance and streamline workflows presents lots of value. In my previous experience, I have worked a lot with machine learning on the side and in research, mostly in the fields of fairness, CV, and graphs. Usually I like Python and PyTorch for creating machine learning solutions, use R for statistical work, and otherwise focus on Java, C, and SQL for other cases.",
